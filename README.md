## Github commit flow and branching
- Given the lack of time I had to work on this project, I didn't have time to do a flow for it and, instead I have pushed the finished code to the main branch, I would have liked to have done a flow for it, but I didn't have time to do it. I hope that this is not a problem and you all understand it.
